Cross-platform mobile app for UCSB students to arrange rides. I implemented front-end components e.g. picker and text box and collaborated in a team using Agile techniques and professional development practices. I performed domain analysis and design documentation with system design artifacts including system sequence diagrams, static class diagrams, interaction diagrams, and state diagrams.
